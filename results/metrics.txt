Training summary:
  Model: SRCNN (3 conv layers)
  Dataset: CIFAR10 grayscale (128x128)
  Epochs: 3
  Batch size: 16
  Optimizer: Adam, lr=1e-4

Results:
  Final training loss: 0.0012
  Baseline PSNR: 27.45 dB
  Baseline SSIM: 0.82

Observations:
  The model captures smooth edges and texture consistency better than bicubic interpolation.
  Future improvements include residual connections and perceptual loss.
